            <h2>Drills</h2>
            <p>Drills are a fundamental part of NCC training and play a vital role in instilling discipline, coordination, and a sense of unity among cadets. Through regular practice of parade drills such as saluting, marching, and rifle handling, cadets learn to follow commands promptly and maintain proper posture and timing. These drills not only improve physical fitness and alertness but also help develop leadership qualities and team spirit. The synchronized movements during a parade reflect the dedication, discipline, and hard work of cadets, making drills an essential and proud tradition in the NCC curriculum.
