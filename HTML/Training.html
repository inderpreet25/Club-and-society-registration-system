        <h2>Training in NCC</h2>
        <p>
            Training in the National Cadet Corps (NCC) plays a vital role in shaping the character, discipline, and leadership qualities of young cadets. It includes physical training, drill, weapon handling, map reading, adventure activities, and social service. Through this structured training, cadets develop a strong sense of responsibility, teamwork, and patriotism. The aim is not only to prepare youth for a career in the armed forces but also to create disciplined and motivated citizens who can contribute positively to society. NCC training builds confidence and resilience, helping cadets face challenges in all walks of life.
