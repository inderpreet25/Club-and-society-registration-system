    <h2>Adventure Activities</h2>
    <p>Adventure activities are an integral part of NCC training, aimed at developing confidence, leadership, and a spirit of exploration among cadets. These include trekking, rock climbing, mountaineering, paragliding, scuba diving, and cycle expeditions. Such activities challenge the physical and mental strength of cadets, encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones and work as a team. Adventure training not only promotes physical fitness but also instills qualities like courage, discipline, and determination. Through these thrilling experiences, NCC helps nurture well-rounded individuals who are prepared to face challenges with confidence and resilience.
